Q3b: 1 point: Explain Man in the middle attack in Diffie Hellman key exchange.

Essentially, a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack can be successfully done in this exchange
in the initial broadcast of the public values. If either party is not verified as the correct
party, then the sharing of whole process is pointless - this is why fingerprinting is very very
important in secure communications and why SSH will yell at you by default if your server's fingerprint
changes.
